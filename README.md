# CSS Documentation 

## Introduction
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. It defines how elements should be rendered on screen, paper, or in other media.


## CSS Syntax
CSS follows a specific syntax where styles are applied to elements using **selectors** and **declaration blocks**. The declaration block contains **properties** and **values** which define the styles for the elements.

---

## Including CSS in HTML
There are three ways to incorporate CSS into an HTML document:

1. **Inline CSS**: Applies CSS directly within an HTML element's `style` attribute.
2. **Internal CSS**: Embedded in the HTML file using the `<style>` tag inside the `<head>`.
3. **External CSS**: Linked as a separate `.css` file using the `<link>` tag.

---

## Color Properties
CSS provides properties to manipulate the color of elements:

- **color**: Sets the foreground (text) color.
- **background-color**: Defines the background color of an element.
- **Color Formats**: Can be defined using named colors, RGB values, hexadecimal codes

---

## CSS Selectors
CSS selectors are used to target HTML elements for styling:

- **Universal Selector (`*`)**: Selects all elements in the document.
- **Element Selector**: Selects all instances of a specific HTML element.
- **ID Selector (`#id`)**: Targets a single element with a specific `id` attribute.
- **Class Selector (`.class`)**: Targets elements with a specific `class` attribute.

---

## Text Properties
CSS provides a set of properties to control the appearance of text:

- **text-align**: Specifies horizontal alignment of text within an element.
- **font-weight**: Determines the thickness or boldness of the text.
- **text-decoration**: Adds effects like underline, overline, or strikethrough to text.
- **font-family**: Sets the typeface or font family for the text.
- **text-transform**: Controls capitalization and transformation of text.
- **line-height**: Defines the space between lines of text.
- **font-size**: Specifies the size of the text.

---

## Box Model
The **CSS Box Model** is a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of the following properties:

- **Content**: The actual content inside the box (text, images, etc.).
- **Padding**: Clears an area around the content (inside the border) 
- **Border**: Surrounds the padding and content.
- **Margin**: Clears an area outside the border.
  

  * Atribute related to Content
    - `Width`
    - `Height`
  * Atributes related to padding
    - `padding-left`
    - `padding-right`
    - `padding-top`
    - `padding-bottom`
    - `padding`: top,right,bottom,left
  * Atributes related to margin
    - margin-left
    - margin-right
    - margin-top
    - margin-bottom
    - margin : top,right,bottom,left
  * Atribute related to Broder
    - Border-width
    - Baroder-style: solid/dotted/dash
    - Border-color
    - Border: width style color
    - Border-radius: 

The Box Model determines the elementâ€™s dimensions and space between elements.

---

## Display Properties
The **display** property controls how an element is displayed on the web page. Common display values include:

- **block**: The element takes up the entire width available, with a line break before and after.
- **inline**: The element takes up only as much width as it needs, without breaking the line.
- **inline-block**: Similar to `inline`, but allows setting `width` and `height`.
- **none**: The element is not displayed (removed from the document flow).

---

## Visibility
The **visibility** property determines whether an element is visible or hidden, while still occupying space in the layout.

- **visible**: The element is visible (default).
- **hidden**: The element is hidden, but space is still reserved.

## Positioning

### Position Property
The position CSS property defines how an element is positioned in the document. Common values include:

* static: The default positioning. The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect.
* relative: The element is positioned relative to its original position. The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties will work.
* absolute: Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. The element is removed from the document flow.
* fixed: Positioned relative to the browser window, staying in place when the page is scrolled.
* sticky: Positioned based on the user's scroll position.

## Background Image :
Used to set an image as background
* background-image : url("image.jpeg");
* background-size : cover / contain / auto

## Flexbox
Flexible Box Layout: It is a one-dimensional layout method for arranging items in rows or columns.
#### The Flex Model
##### Flexbox Direction: It sets how flex items are placed in the flex container, along which axis and direction.
* flex-direction : row; (default)
* flex-direction : row-reverse;
* flex-direction : column;
* flex-direction : column-reverse;

#### Flex Properties: for Flex Container
* justify-content : alignment along the main axis(flex-start / flex-end / centre /space-evenly)
* flex-wrap : nowrap / wrap / wrap-reverse 
* align-items : alignment along the cross axis.
* align-content : alignment of space between & around the content along cross-axis

#### Flex Properties
* align-self : alignment of individual along the cross axis.space is available
* flex-grow : how much a flex item will grow relative to the rest of the flex items if
* flex-shrink : how much a flex item will shrink relative to the rest of the flex items if space is available

 #### Media Queries
 - Help create responsive websites for various screen sizes and orientations.
 - Examples:
   ```css
   @media (max-width: 600px) {
       div { background-color: red; }
    }
   @media (min-width: 600px) {
       div { background-color: blue; }
   }
   ```
 - Ensure layouts look good on devices like laptops, phones, tablets, etc.

#### Transitions
 - Define changes between element states smoothly.
 - Key properties:
   - `transition-property`: e.g., font-size, width.
   - `transition-duration`: e.g., 2s, 400ms.
   - `transition-timing-function`: e.g., ease-in, linear.
   - `transition-delay`: e.g., 0.2s.

#### CSS Transforms
 - Apply 2D/3D transformations:
   - **Rotate**: `transform: rotate(45deg);`
   - **Scale**: `transform: scale(2);`
   - **Translate**: `transform: translate(20px, 50px);`
   - **Skew**: `transform: skew(30deg);`
#### PSEUDO CLASS
1. `:hover` - Selects links or elements when the mouse hovers over them. It's widely used for styling interactive elements like buttons and links.
2. `:active` - Selects an element when it is being activated (e.g., when a link is clicked). It is often used for styling the click state of buttons and links.
3. `:focus` - Selects an element (like an input) when it has focus, commonly used to style form fields or interactive elements for accessibility.
4. `:visited` - Selects all links that have been visited by the user, allowing for different styling based on the link state.
5. `:first-child` - Selects the first child of a parent element, often used for styling the first item in a list or section differently.

#### Animation
* To animate CSS elements

```
 @keyframe myName {
from { font-size : 20px; } to { font-size : 40px; }
}
```
* Animation Properties
`animation-name`
`animation-duration`
`nimation-timing-function`
`animation-delay`
`animation-iteration-count`
`animation-direction`

* Animation Shorthand

- animation : myName 2s linear 3s infinite normal

* % in Animation
```
@keyframe myName {
0% { font-size : 20px; }
50% { font-size : 30px; }
100% { font-size : 40px; }
}
```
